## Why get things done?

<!--
I used to deal with big volumes of incoming emails. Easily hundreds of messages during a workday.

Since my situation wasn't unique I have learned from my coworkers some tricks that are now applicable in my personal inbox (<100 messages/week).

Why do I like it?
- I execute the process when it works best for me.
- The rapid pace makes each step feel satisfying.
- It avoids the pitfals of notifications or missed emails.

-->

- Based on lessons learned when deailng with hundreds of incoming messages.
- In a daily or weekly session go through a batch of incoming messages.
    - No ongoing distractions.
    - No anxiety over missed emails.
    - A rapid pace makes process *satisfying*.

## The workflow

<!--
I prefer starting with the newest "important" emails.

I use gmail's stars ⭐ to mark my current context.
-->

Go through emails one by one. Ideally: **touch each email exactly once** and decide its fate:

1. Is it actionable?
    * **No**: Categorize and archive it.
2) Is it a single 2-minute action?
    * **Yes**: Do it now!
3) Is this a task for you?
    - **Yes**: Move to Todo.
    - **No**: Delegate and snooze.

## My Setup

## Inbox sections

![bg right fit](img/inbox_setup.png)

I use the following 4 sections:
1. Important and unread
2. **All** Starred
    - Including archived items. Look for it in *More options...*
3. Important
4. Everything else

## Snooze

Shortcut: `b`

![bg left:33% fit](img/snooze.png)

When you're waiting for someone to get back to you, snooze it.

<!--
Make sure it doesn't slip through the cracks.

## Todo
Shortcut: `Shift + t`
![](img/add_task.png)

Tasks that need planning or more time go to the Todo list and the email gets archived.

The task will link back to the email.

You can also drag from the message list to the sidebar.

## Speed up

Increase your pace by using keyboard shortcuts. You may need to enable shortcuts in settings first.

- `j`/`k` - Go to next/previous conversation
- `u` - Go to list of conversations
- `e` - Archive
- `s` - Star
- `b` - Snooze
- `Shift + t` - Create a Task
- `z` - Undo last action
- `?` - See all shortcuts
